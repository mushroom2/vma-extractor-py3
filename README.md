VMA extractor
=============

`vma.py` implements an extraction tool for the VMA backup format used by
[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com). The tool is implemented in Python2.

Usage:
```sh
./vma.py path/to/source.vma path/to/target/directory
```

I think it is pretty important to be able to read Proxmox backups outside of a
Proxmox environment. Yet, porting their VMA implementation to a standalone
tool proved difficult. VMA-Reader and VMA-Writer are implemented as patches to
the Proxmox-patched version and Qemu and are thus very difficult to compile on
non-Proxmox systems.

The format specification can be found on [git.proxmox.com](https://git.proxmox.com/?p=pve-qemu.git;a=blob_plain;f=vma_spec.txt;hb=refs/heads/master).
